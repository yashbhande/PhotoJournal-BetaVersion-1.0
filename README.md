# PhotoJournal-BetaVersion-1.0
Hey there! ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the beta version of Your Photo Journal - Stories Told Through Images. ðŸ“¸ðŸŽ‰

Here's the scoop: this is an early version of our project, so it's still a work in progress. Right now, we're keeping things simple and focused on the fun part â€“ sharing your favorite photos and memories. ðŸ“šðŸ“·

Just a heads up, we're still working on a few things:

**Permanent Storage:** We haven't set up a way to store your uploaded images permanently yet. So, if you refresh the page, your images might disappear. ðŸ˜…

**Security Features:** We're not doing any fancy security stuff like usernames, passwords, or user authentication. Right now, it's all about the photos! ðŸ”’

But hey, don't let that stop you from trying it out and sharing your stories through pictures. Have fun exploring Your Photo Journal, and keep an eye out for updates as we continue to improve things! ðŸš€
